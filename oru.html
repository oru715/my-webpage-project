<Preparation>
<p> Boil the meats on high heat,starting with tougher meats first. Offals may be boiled seperately if they are bloody. Add salt and knorr chicken cubes and seasoning, onions are optional, I dont use any. When the meats are almost soft, add the smoked fish and continue to boil till very soft.</p>

<p>While the meats are cooking get the leaves ready.</p>

<p>Slice and wash the water leaves to remove all traces of dirt. Also wash and soak the ukazi/afang leaves in hot water for 2 minutes. This process will help soften the afang leaves

<p>Then transfer the afang leaves into a blender, add a small amount of water, then blend to your preferred consistency.You may also pound or grind the Afang leaves.</p>

<p>Soak the smoked catfish in hot water, clean to remove traces of dirt then shred and set aside..</p>

<p>When the meats are well cooked you should end up with 1-2 cups of stock. To this, add the crayfish,blended pepper,smoked prawns smoked fish, maggi crayfish and periwinkles if you are using. Turn the heat down to medium. leave to cook for 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>Now,add the washed water leaves, stir and combine. Then leave to cook for 2-3 minutes. The water leaves will wilt in the soup as its got quite a lot of water contents, do not be tempted to add too much. Remember we'll still be adding afang leaves</p>
